# US-CS-045 Detect Unknown Role During JD Normalization

## User Story

As Paul, I want the JD normalizer to detect unknown roles so that normalized JD outputs can be reviewed before downstream use.

## Context

Career System is now being used operationally for real job applications.

## Scope

- Define required behavior.
- Maintain traceability to source artifacts.
- Include validation as part of the story, not as an afterthought.

## Out of Scope

- REST API unless explicitly stated.
- React UI unless explicitly stated.
- Trello/Jira automation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Requirement has a clear source artifact.
- Output or behavior is repeatable.
- Status, generated content, or SQL result can be manually validated.
- Story includes manual, programmatic, and regression validation steps.

## Manual Validation Steps

1. Open the relevant artifact, tracker file, or database view.
2. Confirm the expected content, status, or behavior is present.
3. Confirm unrelated artifacts are not polluted or overwritten.

## Programmatic Validation Steps

```bash
grep -R "US-CS-045" docs/requirements || true
```

Add story-specific validation command during implementation.

## Regression Validation Steps

1. Re-run the affected workflow.
2. Validate at least three recent examples where applicable.
3. Confirm prior approved content remains intact.
