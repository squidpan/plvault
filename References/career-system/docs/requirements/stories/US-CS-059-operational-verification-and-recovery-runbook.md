# US-CS-059 Operational Verification and Recovery Runbook

## TL;DR

- Verify Career System is operational after recovery.
- Execute the complete workflow using documented procedures.
- Confirm recovery is repeatable by following the runbook.
- Establish operational acceptance criteria.
- Define the transition from recovery planning to implementation.

---

# User Story

As a Career System operator,

I want to verify the recovered workflow using documented operational procedures,

so that the system can be used confidently for real job applications.

---

# Business Context

Recovery is not complete simply because individual scripts execute successfully.

The complete operational workflow must be executable using documented procedures without relying on undocumented knowledge or manual reconstruction.

---

# Current State

Recovery planning has defined the target workflow, recovery stories, and regression validation strategy.

Operational verification will confirm that the restored workflow functions as a complete, repeatable process.

---

# Business Value

Operational verification will:

- Demonstrate recovery success.
- Improve operational confidence.
- Reduce dependence on tribal knowledge.
- Provide a repeatable recovery process for future releases.

---

# Scope

## Included

- End-to-end workflow execution
- Recovery checklist
- Runbook verification
- Operational readiness
- Recovery acceptance review

## Excluded

- New feature development
- Architecture redesign
- Workflow optimization beyond recovery

# Dependencies

- [[EPIC-CS-003-career-system-functional-recovery-and-pipeline-validation]]
- [[US-CS-056-restore-end-to-end-workflow-orchestration]]
- [[US-CS-057-restore-final-application-package-generation]]
- [[US-CS-058-regression-validation-against-historical-application-packages]]

---

# Acceptance Criteria

- The documented workflow can be executed from Job Description through Application Package.
- Required recovery runbooks are complete and current.
- Recovery checklist is executed successfully.
- Regression validation has passed.
- No undocumented manual recovery steps remain.
- Recovery completion can be demonstrated by following the documented procedures alone.

---

# Implementation Notes

Operational verification should be performed using the same procedures that future users or maintainers will follow.

The goal is to validate the documentation as well as the software.

---

# Validation

## Manual Validation

Execute the complete recovery workflow using only the documented runbooks.

## Programmatic Validation

Verify required artifacts, logs, and validation outputs are generated.

## Operational Validation

Confirm that recovery can be repeated without undocumented intervention.

---

# Operational Exit Criteria

Operational recovery is considered complete only when all of the following are true:

- The complete JD-to-Application Package workflow executes successfully.
- US-CS-058 regression validation has passed.
- Required recovery runbooks accurately describe the implemented workflow.
- No undocumented manual recovery steps remain.
- Recovery stories have been completed or explicitly deferred.
- Recovery implementation artifacts have been updated.
- The recovery implementation can be repeated on a clean repository state.

Completion of this story represents operational acceptance rather than feature completion.

# Learning Outcomes

## Technical

Improve confidence in the operational workflow.

## Engineering

Strengthen operational documentation and recovery discipline.

## Operational

Establish a repeatable recovery process for future maintenance.

# Framework Improvement Opportunities

Potential future EFK improvements:

- Operational readiness checklist
- Recovery acceptance template
- Standard operational verification artifact
