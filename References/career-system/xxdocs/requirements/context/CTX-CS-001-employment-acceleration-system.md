## Business Problem

Job search work is fragmented across job boards, resumes, notes, trackers, files, and interview preparation materials. Without a system, it is difficult to know which jobs are worth pursuing, what gaps exist, and which artifact should be used for each application.

## Desired Outcome

Career System should reduce wasted effort, improve application quality, and create reusable evidence of professional BA, requirements, data, API, and AI-assisted workflow skills.

Learning System Principle
=========================

Career System is not merely a resume generation system.

Career System is intended to become a learning system
whose recommendations improve as additional job
descriptions, applications, resumes, gap analyses,
interview preparation packages, and hiring outcomes
are accumulated.

The value of the system should increase over time.

Examples:

More JDs
→ Better role classification

More applications
→ Better prioritization

More resumes
→ Better tailoring

More outcomes
→ Better fit scoring

More interview preparation
→ Better recommendations

Knowledge Accumulation
----------------------

Career System should accumulate reusable knowledge
from prior job descriptions, resumes, applications,
interviews, and outcomes.

Knowledge generated for one application should
improve future applications whenever possible.
