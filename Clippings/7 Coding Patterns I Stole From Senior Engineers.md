7 Coding Patterns I Stole From Senior Engineers

*If not a Medium member?* [**CLICK HERE**](https://medium.com/skillstuff/7-coding-patterns-i-stole-from-senior-engineers-c95f757e52a6?sk=477dbb293debc13fd5de6e68a4526571)

Most junior developers think senior engineers know more tricks.

They usually do not.

They just create fewer problems for the next person.

That is the painful difference.

I used to think clean code meant elegant code. Then I worked with engineers who had carried broken systems through production incidents, late-night rollbacks, half-migrated databases, unclear ownership, angry customers, and codebases nobody wanted to touch. Their code was not flashy. It was not full of clever abstractions. It did not look like something written to impress Twitter.

It looked boring.

Then the requirements changed, and their code survived.

That is when I started paying attention.

The best patterns I stole from senior engineers were not framework-specific. They were not React patterns, Node patterns, Java patterns, or cloud patterns. They were judgment pa ==tterns. Ways== of writing code that made bugs easier to find, changes easier to make, and systems harder to misunderstand.

Here are seven of them.

## 1\. They Return Early Instead of Building Conditional Mazes

The first pattern I stole was embarrassingly simple: return early.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*L8AQOOezW2bBq_og2RZN5g.png)

I used to write functions as if I were building a tunnel. Every condition pushed the real logic deeper into the file. First, check the user. Then check the input. Then check the permission. Then check the feature flag. Then check the database result. By the time the actual business logic appeared, it was six indentation levels deep and emotionally exhausted.

Senior engineers did not do that.

They removed the bad paths first.

```c
async function updateUserProfile(userId: string, input: ProfileInput) {
  const user = await getUser(userId);

  if (!user) {
    throw new NotFoundError("User not found");
  }
  
  if (!input.email) {
    throw new ValidationError("Email is required");
  }
 
  if (!user.canEditProfile) {
    throw new ForbiddenError("User cannot edit profile");
  }
  return saveProfile(user.id, input);
}
```

This is not glamorous. Nobody gets promoted for saying, “I used guard clauses.” But code like this changes how a team debugs.

The failure paths are visible. The happy path is not buried. The function reads in the order a developer thinks during an incident: what can stop this from working, and what happens when those things are not true?

The bad version feels harmless at first:

```c
async function updateUserProfile(userId: string, input: ProfileInput) {
  const user = await getUser(userId);

  if (user) {
    if (input.email) {
      if (user.canEditProfile) {
        return saveProfile(user.id, input);
      }
    }
  }
  throw new Error("Unable to update profile");
}
```

This looks small enough to survive. Then someone adds account status checks. Someone adds organization permissions. Someone adds email verification rules. Someone adds audit logging. Now the function is a cave.

Nested code hides meaning. It forces the reader to hold too much state in their head.

Senior engineers know that reading code is more expensive than writing it. They optimize for the person trying to understand the code under pressure.

There are exceptions. Sometimes nested structures express a real hierarchy. Sometimes a parser, tree traversal, or complex workflow needs nested logic. The pattern is not “never nest.” The pattern is: do not make the reader walk through five doors before they find the point.

Takeaway: remove the failure paths early so the real logic can breathe.

## 2\. They Name the Business Meaning, Not the Technical Accident

Bad names are not a cosmetic problem.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*mIJt77La623jnaD-wiy7ew.png)

They are a debugging task.

A lot of developers name things after what the code technically contains: `data`, `result`, `item`, `payload`, `response`, `temp`, `obj`, `list`, `value`. The code compiles. The feature works. Everyone moves on.

Then the system grows.

Now `data` is a user. This `result` is a payment authorization. This `payload` is actually a password reset request. `items` are invoices, but only unpaid invoices, except when they include canceled ones, because a filter changed last quarter.

Senior engineers name things after business meaning because that meaning survives implementation changes.

Compare this:

```c
const result = await getData(id);

if (result.status === "active") {
  await process(result);
}
```

With this:

```c
const subscription = await getSubscription(subscriptionId);

if (subscription.isBillable) {
  await chargeSubscription(subscription);
}
```

The second version does more than look cleaner. It tells the next developer what matters. It says this is not just a record. It is a subscription. The important condition is not a vague status check. It is whether the subscription can be billed.

That distinction saves time.

==I have seen production bugs where the code was technically correct but semantically unclear. A variable named== ==`activeUsers`== ==included users who were suspended but not deleted. A function named== ==`syncCustomer`== ==also created invoices. A boolean named== ==`isValid`== ==meant “passes frontend validation,” not “safe to persist.”==

The bugs were not caused by the names alone. But the names made wrong assumptions easier.

A better name creates friction against misuse.

```c
const usersEligibleForReactivation = await findUsersEligibleForReactivation();
```

Yes, it is longer.

Good.

Some names should be long because the business rule is specific. A short, vague name is not simpler. It just moves the complexity into someone else’s memory.

The nuance is that naming can become performative. You do not need a paragraph for every variable. A loop index can be `i`. A local callback can be simple. The goal is not theatrical naming. The goal is to name the concepts that carry business risk.

Takeaway: senior engineers name code so the next developer does not have to reverse-engineer intent from implementation.

## 3\. They Put Boundaries Around External Chaos

Senior engineers do not trust external systems to stay polite.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*nqRXzJ9PoKQgzO1URsck7A.png)

APIs change. Webhooks arrive late. Third-party fields disappear. Payment providers return weird edge cases. Auth tokens expire at the worst possible moment. Date formats become a crime scene. A “temporary” integration starts powering half the product.

Junior code often lets that chaos leak everywhere.

```c
const userName = response.data.user_name;
const isActive = response.data.status === "ACTIVE";
const plan = response.data.subscription.plan_name;
```

This starts in one file. Then it spreads. Soon, half the codebase knows the exact shape of a third-party response. That means the third-party vendor is now part of your internal architecture.

Senior engineers usually create a boundary.

```c
function mapBillingCustomer(response: BillingCustomerResponse): Customer {
  return {
    id: response.id,
    name: response.user_name,
    isBillable: response.status === "ACTIVE",
    planName: response.subscription?.plan_name ?? "Free"
  };
}
```

This is not just mapping. It is containment.

The rest of the system should not care whether the vendor says `user_name`, `customerName`, `profile.display_name`, or something worse. The rest of the system should receive a shape that your team owns.

This pattern applies everywhere.

Do not let raw database rows leak into UI logic.  
Do not let HTTP response shapes leak into domain logic.  
Do not let framework-specific request objects leak into business services.  
Do not let environment variable parsing happen randomly across files.  
Do not let Stripe, Slack, GitHub, Salesforce, or any other external system become the language of your entire codebase.

I learned this one the hard way during an integration change. A third-party API renamed a field in a minor version update. The field was referenced directly in controllers, background jobs, analytics events, and a React dashboard. The fix was not difficult. Finding every place that depended on the field was the painful part.

The better version would have failed in one adapter test.

That is the difference.

The nuance is that boundaries have a cost. If the app is tiny, a full mapping layer for everything can be overkill. But once external data crosses multiple features, you need a place where outside chaos becomes inside language.

Takeaway: never let systems you do not control define the shape of systems you do control.

## 4\. They Write Code That Makes Invalid States Boringly Hard

A senior engineer once reviewed my code and said, “This lets the impossible case exist.”

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*QlD6lTkfLkH1tnxPRtiumQ.png)

That sentence annoyed me because the feature worked.

Then it broke two weeks later.

The code had a user object with optional fields everywhere:

```c
type User = {
  id?: string;
  email?: string;
  role?: string;
  status?: string;
};
```

Everything was optional because it made TypeScript stop complaining. That is not type safety. That is surrender.

The application now had to ask the same anxious questions everywhere:

Does this user have an ID?  
Does this user have an email?  
Is the role defined?  
Is status one of the expected values?  
Can this user be saved?  
Can this user be displayed?  
Can this user be invited?

Senior engineers avoid making every caller defend against nonsense. They model states more honestly.

```c
type DraftUser = {
  email: string;
  role: "admin" | "member";
};

type SavedUser = {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  role: "admin" | "member";
  status: "active" | "disabled";
};
```

Now the code can express a real difference: a draft user is not a saved user.

That sounds obvious. But many bugs come from code pretending two different states are the same thing.

A payment is not just a payment. It might be pending, authorized, captured, failed, refunded, or disputed. An order is not just an order. It might be a cart, submitted order, fulfilled order, canceled order, or returned order. A user is not just a user. They might be invited, active, suspended, deleted, or pending verification.

When these states are represented loosely, the bugs become repetitive.

Someone sends an email to a user without a verified address. Someone refunds a payment that was never captured. Someone shows a dashboard action for an account that has not completed onboarding. Someone assumes a field exists because it exists “after this step,” except that the code path skipped that step.

A better model does not eliminate all validation. It makes wrong usage visible earlier.

```c
type Payment =
  | { state: "pending"; id: string }
  | { state: "authorized"; id: string; authorizationId: string }
  | { state: "captured"; id: string; receiptId: string }
  | { state: "failed"; id: string; reason: string };
```

Now, a function that sends receipts can require a captured payment:

```c
function sendReceipt(payment: Extract<Payment, { state: "captured" }>) {
  return emailReceipt(payment.receiptId);
}
```

This is not about worshiping types. You can apply the same idea in dynamic languages with validation, constructors, schemas, factories, or clear runtime checks.

The exact tool matters less than the discipline.

Takeaway: Senior engineers do not just handle invalid states. They design code so invalid states have fewer places to hide.

## 5\. They Separate Decisions From Actions

One of the most useful patterns I stole was separating decisions from actions.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*_M8e2TGdoJg32Xj3Ctt75w.png)

A lot of code mixes these:

```c
async function refundInvoice(invoiceId: string) {
  const invoice = await getInvoice(invoiceId);

  if (invoice.status !== "paid") {
    throw new Error("Invoice cannot be refunded");
  }

  if (invoice.refundedAt) {
    throw new Error("Invoice already refunded");
  }

  if (invoice.amount <= 0) {
    throw new Error("Invalid refund amount");
  }

  await paymentProvider.refund(invoice.paymentId);
  await markInvoiceRefunded(invoice.id);
  await sendRefundEmail(invoice.customerId);
}
```

This is not terrible. It is readable enough. But the decision and the action are glued together.

That makes testing heavier than it needs to be. If you want to test refund eligibility, you may need to mock payment providers, database calls, email services, and whatever else the function touches. So the tests become annoying. Then the team writes fewer tests. Then the refund rules break.

Senior engineers often pull the decision into a pure function.

```c
function getRefundEligibility(invoice: Invoice): RefundEligibility {
  if (invoice.status !== "paid") {
    return { allowed: false, reason: "Invoice is not paid" };
  }

  if (invoice.refundedAt) {
    return { allowed: false, reason: "Invoice is already refunded" };
  }

  if (invoice.amount <= 0) {
    return { allowed: false, reason: "Invalid refund amount" };
  }

  return { allowed: true };
}
```

Then the action becomes simpler:

```c
async function refundInvoice(invoiceId: string) {
  const invoice = await getInvoice(invoiceId);
  const eligibility = getRefundEligibility(invoice);

  if (!eligibility.allowed) {
    throw new ValidationError(eligibility.reason);
  }

  await paymentProvider.refund(invoice.paymentId);
  await markInvoiceRefunded(invoice.id);
  await sendRefundEmail(invoice.customerId);
}
```

Now the business rules can be tested without mocking the world.

That is the real win.

This pattern shows up everywhere: permission checks, feature access, pricing rules, validation, routing decisions, retry logic, notification rules, workflow transitions, and scheduling behavior.

When decisions are mixed with actions, the rules become harder to see and harder to trust. When decisions are separated, the rules become inspectable.

The nuance is that you do not need to split every three-line function into a miniature architecture. If the logic is trivial and unlikely to change, keep it simple. But when a decision carries business risk, give it a name and a test.

Takeaway: decisions should be easy to test without triggering the side effects they control.

## 6\. They Make Errors Useful to the Next Person

Bad error handling is developer ego in disguise.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*d-zfSoR-sYkBzl6qBA52Vg.png)

The code fails, and the error says:

```c
Something went wrong
```

Useful to whom?

Not the user. Not support. Not the developer on call. Not the person checking logs at midnight. Not the frontend trying to show a meaningful state. Not the backend engineer trying to connect a failed request to a trace.

Senior engineers treat errors as communication.

A good error does not expose sensitive internals. It does not dump stack traces into the UI. It does not tell attackers how the system works. But it does give the right people enough information to move.

A weak API error looks like this:

```c
{
  "message": "Something went wrong"
}
```

A stronger one might look like this:

```c
{
  "code": "USER_EMAIL_ALREADY_EXISTS",
  "message": "A user with this email already exists.",
  "details": {
    "field": "email"
  },
  "requestId": "req_8f91a2"
}
```

The important part is not the exact field names. Some teams use `errorCode`. Some use `type`. Some use problem-details formats. Some put request IDs in headers. That is fine.

The mistake is returning vague human text and expecting every client, log, dashboard, and support workflow to somehow understand it.

I have seen frontend code parse error messages like this:

```c
if (error.message.includes("already exists")) {
  showEmailTakenError();
}
```

That code is a hostage situation.

The backend changes the wording, and the frontend breaks. A translator adjusts the copy, and the logic breaks. A different endpoint returns similar text, and the UI shows the wrong state.

Text is for humans. Codes are for systems.

Senior engineers also include context in logs:

```c
logger.warn("Refund rejected", {
  invoiceId,
  customerId,
  reason: eligibility.reason,
  requestId
});
```

Not everything needs to be logged. Logging sensitive data is a serious mistake. Passwords, tokens, personal data, payment details, and secrets do not belong in logs. But useful identifiers, safe context, and structured reasons can turn an incident from a guessing session into a traceable path.

Takeaway: errors should help the next person understand what failed, where it failed, and what evidence connects the failure.

## 7\. They Optimize for the Diff, Not the Demo

Junior developers often optimize for getting the feature working locally.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*NF1uTEX1z-E1UtwcUWCHgw.png)

Senior engineers optimize for the change being reviewable.

That difference is huge.

A feature can work perfectly in a demo and still be dangerous to merge. The code may touch too many areas. The diff may mix refactoring with behavior changes. The tests may prove only the happy path. The migration may be hidden inside unrelated work. The configuration change may not be documented. The rollback path may be unclear.

The demo works.

The system gets riskier.

Senior engineers think in diffs because diffs are how teams absorb change.

A clean diff tells a story. It says what changed, why it changed, and what behavior is now different. A messy diff turns code review into archaeology.

The bad version looks like this:

```c
feat: update billing flow
- refactor invoice service
- rename payment fields
- update refund logic
- change dashboard UI
- add new webhook handler
- modify retry behavior
- fix customer status bug
- update tests
```

That is not a pull request. That is a hostage note.

Reviewers cannot tell which changes are necessary and which are opportunistic. Bugs hide inside noise. Rollbacks become scary because reverting the feature also reverts unrelated cleanup.

A better approach is boring and disciplined:

```c
PR 1: Rename payment fields without behavior changes
PR 2: Add refund eligibility helper with tests
PR 3: Wire refund eligibility into billing flow
PR 4: Update dashboard UI to show refund reason
PR 5: Add webhook retry behavior
```

This feels slower if you only count typing.

It is faster if you count review, debugging, rollback, and trust.

Senior engineers are careful about mixing refactors with behavior changes. They still refactor. They just avoid hiding product changes inside cleanup and cleanup inside product changes.

This pattern matters most under pressure. During an incident, a small focused diff is a gift. A giant diff is a threat. When something breaks, the team needs to know what changed. If everything changed, nobody knows anything.

Takeaway: code is not done when it works on your machine. It is done when the change is understandable, reviewable, testable, and safe to undo.

## The Pattern Under the Patterns

These seven patterns look different on the surface.

Guard clauses. Better names. Boundaries. Safer states. Separated decisions. Useful errors. Reviewable diffs.

Underneath, they are all the same idea.

Reduce surprise.

Senior engineers are not allergic to complexity. They just know complexity has to live somewhere. If you do not put it in clear names, explicit boundaries, honest types, focused functions, useful errors, and small diffs, it spreads into people’s heads.

That is where software becomes exhausting.

A confusing codebase not only slows delivery. It makes developers less confident. They hesitate before changing things. They over-test manually because they do not trust the system. They ask the same questions in Slack. They avoid old modules. They copy patterns they do not understand. They ship small changes with big anxiety.

That is not because they are weak developers.

It is because the codebase keeps making every change feel risky.

The best senior engineers I worked with were not trying to look smart. They were trying to make the next change less stupid.

That is the difference.

Good code is not code that shows how much you know.

Good code is code that gives the next developer fewer reasons to guess.

If this hit hard, share it with a developer who needs to hear it.
