# Grafana Dashboards Usage Configuration

## Summary
- Configuration of Grafana dashboards to monitor real-time system performance
- Focus on low-latency, high-throughput environments
- Critical for SRE observability and rapid incident detection

## Key Points
- Dashboards are composed of panels querying data sources like [[Prometheus]]
- Key configuration elements:
  - data source selection (metrics backend)
  - query definitions (e.g., PromQL)
  - refresh intervals (e.g., 1s–5s for low latency systems)
  - time range settings (short windows for real-time visibility)
- Use templating variables to filter by:
  - service
  - environment
  - region
- Panel types:
  - time-series graphs for latency and throughput
  - gauges for saturation and capacity
  - tables for error breakdowns

## Interview Insights
- For low-latency systems (e.g., trading or market data platforms like Pico Redline):
  - use high-frequency refresh intervals
  - minimize dashboard query complexity to reduce lag
  - focus on critical metrics only (avoid heavy dashboards)
- Dashboards should support:
  - rapid anomaly detection
  - correlation across services
- Trade-off:
  - higher refresh frequency → higher load on metrics backend
- Pre-aggregated metrics improve dashboard performance

## Real-World Usage
- Monitoring real-time market data feeds for latency spikes
- Tracking message throughput and packet loss
- Visualizing network performance for trading infrastructure
- Detecting microbursts or transient latency issues
